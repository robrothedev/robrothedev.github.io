<h1>About this...</h1>
<p>For over 14 years I've been developing websites and web apps for a variety of clients using several technologies, recently using AngularJS.</p>
<p>Learning AngularJS has been a semi-steep curve.  Most of the learning process consisted of finding examples, solutions and how-to's across the web, usually finding the answer within a blog post.
Since then, I've become very comfortable developing applications with AngularJS and intend on sharing my experiences and examples to anyone new to the AngularJS world in hopes of providing solid information
to help new and current developers find solutions to any issues they might come across.</p>
<p>Blog posts soon to come...</p>
